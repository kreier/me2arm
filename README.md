# MeArm

This successful product is used worldwide. Some chinese shops still sell the flawed v0.4 as set cut from 2mm acrylic with all nuts and screws. It's time to upgrade.

## v3.0 from 2018

This edition has many previous issues fixed. It only introduces 2 new problems: 

1. It needs M2.5 screws (thankfully no nuts):
  - 16x 10mm
  - 8x 16mm
  - 16x 6mm
  
2. It needs a PCB for the bottom. The latter one needs to be ordered somewhere else, not with the laser cut, and the gerber file is not yet publicly released.

So I created my own:

## PCB for v3.0

The created file can be ordered at JCBPCB and fits. I ordered
