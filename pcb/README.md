# PCB for MeArm v3.0

The version 3.0 needs a pcb in the bottom for the general structure, but provides an easy way to connect the 4 servos with just 1 ribbon cable on one connector. The file was not yet released, so I created a replica.

## Files

The files are mearm3_pcb.zip and can be sent to JCBPCB.com to manufacture this file. Additionally there is a small part in the top part that should be broken of. Equipped with a 6pin IDC DC3 boxheader and 12 FH on the bottom one can stack the receiver of the 6pin ribbon cable on top of several servo shields where 4 servo outlets are in a row.
